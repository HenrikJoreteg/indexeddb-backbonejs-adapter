This is an [IndexedDB](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/) adapter for [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).

# Warnings

This is a very very very first attempt. I was _only_ tested with Google Chrome 11.
It also requires the current development version of BackboneJS ([branch 0.4.0](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/tree/0.4.0)).

*It lacks a lot of documentation, so it's good idea to look at the tests if you're interested in using it.*
